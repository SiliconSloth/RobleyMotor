# RobleyMotor

RobleyMotor is a simple program to be run on  a [Tetrix Prizm](https://www.tetrixrobotics.com/PRIZM) controller, which allows a pair of motors to be controlled via USB.  It receives pairs of motor powers from the serial port and relays them to the motors.  It is intended for use with [RobleyVision](https://github.com/SiliconSloth/RobleyVision) running on a laptop.

When using RobleyMotor I highly recommend adding something to your robot to keep the green button on the Prizm controller held down, so that you donâ€™t need to press it every time the program restarts.

The easiest way to install RobleyMotor is probably to copy/paste the contents of `main.cpp` into the main source file of a blank Prizm project.  See [this](https://www.tetrixrobotics.com/prizmdownloads) for help setting up a Prizm project in the Arduino IDE.
